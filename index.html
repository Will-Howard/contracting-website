      <p>Morlock Software is me, Will Howard. I'm a former Tech Lead, now independent product engineer for hire. I aim to build solutions that are as simple and easy to use as possible. If I think you don't need to hire an engineer at all and should just use a spreadsheet, I'll tell you that.</p>

      <h2>I can be useful if...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You don't have a dedicated engineer, and you need someone reliable to maintain things and handle feature requests</li>
        <li>You're building a new product (website or app) and want someone who can scope features, talk to users, and make trade-offs between speed and quality, as well as do the engineering</li>
        <li>You're starting a technical project and want advice on how difficult it is, who you need to hire, or the best way to architect it</li>
        <li>Very specific: You use Airtable, and want to do something with it that stretches the ability to use no-code tools, such as using it as the backend for a website</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Introductory call.</strong> We talk about what you need. I'll tell you whether and how I can help.</li>
        <li>If it's a good fit, we agree on a <strong>scoped project</strong> (fixed price, agreed outcome) or an <strong>hourly consulting arrangement</strong>.
      </ol>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I don't have a ton of experience as an independent contractor as I've been employed for most of my career, but much of my work from past jobs is public:</p>

      <p><strong>At <a href="https://bluedot.org/">BlueDot Impact</a>, as a contractor.</strong> Migrated their course platform from an off the shelf service (Bubble) to their own website. Built a sync service that replicates their Airtable database to Postgres, which allows the website to serve their ~10k monthly users. More generally I've been doing much of the infrastructure and feature work on the codebase for the past year.</p>

      <p><strong>At the <a href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>, as Tech Lead.</strong> Built out our internal data infrastructure, joining up sources from different programmes into a shared data warehouse. Cut cloud costs by ~$60k/year through infrastructure work. Built features for the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/">EA Forum</a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a>, examples: Google Doc import, draft comments, analytics for authors, polls.</p>
