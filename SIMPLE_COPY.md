Morlock Software is me, Will Howard. I'm a former Tech Lead, now independent product engineer. I aim to build solutions that are as simple and easy to use as possible. If I think you don't need to hire an engineer at all and should just use a spreadsheet, I'll tell you that.

Things you could find me useful for:
- ⁠You're a small org or project without a dedicated engineer, and you need someone reliable to maintain things and handle ad-hoc feature requests
- ⁠You're building a new product (website or app) and want someone who can scope features, talk to users, and make trade-offs between speed and quality, as well as do the engineering
- ⁠You're starting a technical project and want advice on how difficult it is, who you need to hire, or the best way to architect it
- ⁠Very specific: You use Airtable, and want to do something with it that stretches the ability to use no-code tools, such as using it as the backend for a website

Things you could find me anti-useful for:
- ⁠Mobile apps
- ⁠Machine Learning proper (i.e. training models)
- ⁠I can design things in a pinch but I'm not aiming to be a design studio

I'm happy to start with a small scoped project or a few hours of advice if you want to see how we'd work together. I'm based in the UK, but don't mind working on US time. Please reach out to me by one of the methods below if you'd like to explore working together.

I don't have a ton of experience as an independent contractor as I've been employed for most of my career, but much of my work from past jobs is public. Here is some of my recent work:
- At [BlueDot Impact](https://bluedot.org/) as a contractor: Migrated their course platform from an off the shelf service (Bubble) to their own website. Built a sync service that replicates their Airtable database to Postgres, which allows the website to serve their ~10k monthly users. More generally I've been doing much of the infrastructure and feature work on the codebase for the past year.
- As Tech Lead at the [Centre for Effective Altruism](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/) (my last day job): Built out our internal data infrastructure, joining up sources from different programmes into a shared data warehouse. Cut cloud costs by ~$60k/year through infrastructure work. Built features for the [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/) and [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/), examples: Google Doc import, draft comments, analytics for authors, polls.
