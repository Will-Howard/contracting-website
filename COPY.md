# Morlock Software

Morlock Software is me, Will Howard. I'm a former Tech Lead, now independent product engineer for hire.

I aim to build solutions that are as straightforward as possible. If I think you don't need to hire an engineer at all and should just use a spreadsheet, I'll tell you that.

## I am the right person for you if...

- You don't have a dedicated engineer, and you need someone reliable to handle maintenance and feature requests.
- You're building a new product (website or app) and want someone who can scope features, talk to users, and make trade-offs between speed and quality, as well as do the engineering.
- You're starting a technical project and want advice on how difficult it is, who you need to hire, or the best way to architect it.
- Very specific: You use Airtable, and want to do something that stretches the ability to use no-code tools, such as using it as the backend for a website.

## Getting started

1. **Introductory call.** We talk about what you need. I'll tell you whether and how I can help.
2. If it's a good fit, we agree on a **scoped project** (fixed price, agreed outcome) or an **hourly consulting arrangement**.

## About

Links: GitHub, LinkedIn, CV, and much of my work from past jobs is public:

**At BlueDot Impact, as a contractor.** Migrated their course platform from an off the shelf service (Bubble) to their own website. Built a sync service that replicates their Airtable database to Postgres, which allows the website to serve their ~10k monthly users. More generally I've been doing much of the infrastructure and feature work on the codebase for the past year.

**At the Centre for Effective Altruism, as Tech Lead.** Built out our internal data infrastructure, joining up sources from different programmes into a shared data warehouse. Cut cloud costs by ~$60k/year through infrastructure work. Built features for the EA Forum and LessWrong, examples: Google Doc import, draft comments, analytics for authors, polls.
