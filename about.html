        Morlock Software is me — Will Howard. I'm a software engineer, most recently Tech Lead at the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>, currently contracting with <a href="https://bluedot.org/">BlueDot Impact</a>. I'm working on moving into robotics safety research over the next couple of years, and taking on contract work while I do.

          BlueDot runs courses on AI safety and is one of the key pipelines for people transitioning into the field. When I joined, the platform was running on Bubble and reading directly from Airtable as its database — which meant the site was slow, unreliable, and every new feature required working around Airtable's limitations rather than just writing normal database queries. I built a sync service that replicates their data to Postgres, and helped migrate the platform off Bubble onto their own website. It now serves around 10,000 monthly active users.

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Tech Lead on the EA Forum (and the shared codebase with LessWrong). Cut cloud costs by about $60k/year by right-sizing our Kubernetes cluster and cleaning up how we used cloud resources. Built out internal data infrastructure, joining up analytics, CRM, and programme data so the growth team had a single view across programmes. Performance work included setting up CDN caching and optimising how pages load — got page loads under 2.4 seconds, down from around 4.

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        Based in London. Studied physics at Oxford, then spent about five years as a software engineer before going independent.

        On the side, I built <a href="https://github.com/Will-Howard/manifolio">Manifolio</a>, a tool for calculating Kelly-optimal bet sizes on prediction markets, which received a grant from <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/impact-market-mini-grants-results">Scott Alexander</a>.
